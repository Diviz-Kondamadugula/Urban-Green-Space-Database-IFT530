# Urban-Green-Space-Database-System

## Project Overview

The **Urban-Green-Space-Database-System** is designed to manage and organize information about urban green spaces, facilitating the tracking and analysis of data related to parks, gardens, and other public green areas. This database system enables efficient storage, retrieval, and management of various entities involved in maintaining urban green spaces.

## Project Structure

This repository contains SQL scripts for creating and managing the database, tables, and data. Below is a brief description of each file:

- **CreatingDB&Tables.sql**: This script creates the database and the necessary tables for managing urban green spaces, including tables for parks, facilities, and maintenance records.
  
- **Populating_Tables.sql**: Contains SQL commands to populate the tables with sample data, representing various parks and facilities, their maintenance schedules, and other related information.
  
- **Audit_Table.sql**: Includes commands for creating audit tables that track changes and updates made to specific records, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
  
- **Cursor.sql**: Demonstrates the use of SQL cursors for iterating over query results, which is useful for automating repetitive tasks within the database.
  
- **StoredProcedure_UDF.sql**: Contains user-defined functions (UDFs) and stored procedures that encapsulate complex logic, enabling reusable and efficient operations within the database.
  
- **Views.sql**: This script creates views for simplifying complex queries and presenting aggregated data, making it easier to extract insights from the underlying tables.
